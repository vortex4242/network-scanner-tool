# Code of Conduct for project participants


## Our commitment


In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as participants and supporters are committed to making participation in our project and our community free from harassment for all regardless of age, build, disability, ethnicity, gender characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation.


## Our Standards


Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:


* Use of welcoming and inclusive language

* Respect for diverse perspectives and experiences

* Accepting constructive criticism with gratitude

* Focusing on what is best for the community

* Showing empathy for other community members


Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:


* Use of sexualized language or images and unwanted sexual attention or advances

* Trolling, offensive/demeaning comments, and personal or political attacks

* Public or personal harassment

* Posting others' personal information, such as physical or e-mail address, without express permission

* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Our Responsibilities


Supporters are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable conduct and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.


Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not in compliance with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, abusive, or harmful.


## Scope


This Code of Conduct applies both in Project spaces and in public spaces when an individual represents the Project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project representation can be further defined and clarified by project supporters.


## Implementation


Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at kirilivanov1312@protonmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate for the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be published separately.


Project supporters who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by other members of project management.
